## Electric Charge

each electron has a negative electric charge.
this charge is measured in the SI unit of coulombs (C).
the amount of charge a single electron has in coulombs is:
$e=1.6*10^{-19}C$ 

this means that you would have one coulomb of negative charge if you collected together $6.25*10^{18}$ electrons.
this is shown in the following equation, where ne = number of electrons and Q is the total charge:
$Q = ne = 6.25*10^{18}*1.6*10^{-19}=1C$

the charge of fundamental particles like electrons is fixed, because it is impossible to create or destroy charge, so the total charge must always be conserved.

## Electric Current

if electric charge moves, this is referred to as an electric current.
the strict definition of current is the *rate* of movement of charge.
like the movement of billions of tiny atoms make up the "flow" of water, billions of tiny charged particles that create a current can also be said to "flow".
the way current can split and recombine at junctions is also analogous to the way water flows in rivers.

Electric current occurs when a charged particle, which is free to move, experiences an electric force.
if the particle is free to move, it will be accelerated by the force.
the movement of charge forms the electric current.

most electric circuits are made using metal wires, because metal contains electrons that are free to move.
these free to move electrons are known as the **conduction electrons**, and they form the current.

any source of electrical energy can create a force and produce a current.

inside cells, the electrons experience a force because they are drawn to the positive anode of the cell, causing a current.

### Calculating Current

the SI unit for electric current is the **ampere**. A current can be calculated from the equation:
###### $A=\frac{C}{s}$

where A is the current, C is the chrage passing a point and s is the time taken for the charge to pass.
therefore, 1 amp of current is 1 coulomb of charge passing a point every second.

this equation can also be arranged to find the charge that has moved through a component in a given time:
$\Delta Q = I\Delta t$
	this can be remembered as the "quit" equation.

### Ionic Charge Carriers

in some unusual circuits, there can be other charged particles, known as **charge carriers**, which can move to form the electric current.

for example, in electrolysis, there are free ions that can move through the liquid as an electric current. these ions are positively charged and will move to the negative cathode.
since this is still an electric circuit, it must obey the rule of conservation of charge, and we can measure the current as the rate of flow of charge.

as the charge of an electron is fixed, we can easily calculate the charge on any ion.
this would be important in a situation where ions were moving as the charge carriers in a current, eg. in electrolysis.
